## Short description

### What's the problem?

COVID-19 has been on a rampage all across the globe since the past 5 months. From less than a million cases in February, and currently having more than 10 million cases across the globe. This has caused widespread panic and disorder. This panic is interfaring with not only the functioning of already established medical structure but also allocation of resources which can cost someone's life.

### How can technology help?

With increasing reach of technology, relevant information can be extracted from concerned authorities. This information can be used in resource allocation to balance load on various authorities. Providing information can keep people informed about the current scenario and have a calming effect.

### The idea

CareQuest aims to bring order to the chaos caused by COVID-19. To do so, CareQuest Services extracts information from its custom network of registered hospitals and government sources which is used in resource allocation and service recommendation with the aim of load balancing.

## Architecture

<p align="center"><img src="https://github.com/barthwalumang/CareQuest/blob/master/public/architecture.png?raw=true" width = "66%" height = "66%"></p>

1. PushBot generates regular updates (new beds in hospitals, new plasma patients/donors, stat updates) to the user and pushes them as notification
2. IBM Watson provides assitance to the user as CareBot as it helps him/her guide through different features and functionalities 
3. User accesses the domain using Heroku services
4. Heroku executes nodeJS to render the website
5. Server requests SendGrid to send mail after either of the plamsa forms is submitted
6. SendGrid sends mail to user that contains form data
7. Server sends requests to Firebase
8. Firebase Authentication manages user login, register, and verification services
9. Firebase sends all id card images to its Firebase Storage / Bucket 
10. ID card image is then sent to Tesseract for OCR processing
11. Firebase registers all variables related to hospital and user and stores them in Firebase Realtime Database
12. HERE Map API (Track-a-Bed) sends hospital data to Firebase Realtime Database to link with user data
13. mongoDB sends all hospital data from its collection to HERE Map APIs to be displayed under Track-a-Bed
